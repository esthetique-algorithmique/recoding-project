Recoding the artwork : Diamond Transformations I from Ruth Leavitt

#pseudo-code

Place a point on paper where you want, from this point place a second point at the right bottom of the first one. Once done, trace a line between these points. Now, trace a new point at the right top of the second (it has to be align with the very first point) and trace a line between them. Now, take these two lines and redo them, the origin point is the last one you draw. Do this like 10 times. 
Ok, now let’s go back to the very second point, place a point at the bottom left (aligned with the first point) of the point then trace a line between them. Once done, copy the exact same line at each “corner” of the first line. Do this for all the points of the first line. 
Ok, now, you can just trace a line between all the extremities of the lines, it should look like the first line we draw except the little tip at the beginning . 
Now the quadrilaterals are close, we’re going to add a little bit of 3D, to do so we just need to redo the step from the beginning.
